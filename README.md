[Laravel Vapor](https://vapor.laravel.com) is an auto-scaling, serverless deployment platform for Laravel, powered by AWS Lambda. Manage your Laravel infrastructure on Vapor and fall in love with the scalability and simplicity of serverless.

Vapor abstracts the complexity of managing Laravel applications on AWS Lambda, as well as interfacing those applications with SQS queues, databases, Redis clusters, networks, CloudFront CDN, and more.

This repository contains the core service providers and runtime client used to make Laravel applications run smoothly in a serverless environment. To learn more about Vapor and how to use this repository, please consult the [official documentation](https://docs.vapor.build).
